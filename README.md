Hello!
Welcome to KLIC-KCL, the repository of Dr. Bipin Rajendran's King's Laboratory for Intelligent Computing (KLIC).
We are interested in creating brain-inspired algorithms and hardware architectures for the post-Moore's law era and the age of AI.
Our interests span wise- from the novel devices and their exotic physics, to clever circuits and systems that push the limits, and algorithms that borrow ideas from nature, physics and the greatest computer ever created- The Brain!
Intelligent compute to compute intelligence!
Creators - Stefan, Rob, Zihang, Abin, Chen, Dengyu, Luis, Prabodh...
